INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use only one category from the list above.
- Base your decision strictly on the information in the incident description.
- Choose the highest reasonable priority if multiple could apply:
  - critical: active or imminent threat to life or large-scale harm
  - high: serious threat, weapons present, or rapidly escalating situation
  - medium: notable incident needing response but limited immediate danger
  - low: minor, informational, or routine matter
- In the explanation, explicitly reference key details from the incident that justify both the category and the priority.
- Do not invent facts that are not mentioned in the incident.
