## Conclusion

The SIMS-SMART device implementation is **80% complete**. Core infrastructure, networking, GPS, LED feedback, and state machine are fully implemented. The remaining 20% requires:

1. ESP32-SR library installation (5 minutes)
2. Camera service implementation (2-3 hours)
3. Audio service implementation (2-3 hours)
4. Integration testing (1 day)

The project is ready for hardware testing once camera and audio services are implemented.
